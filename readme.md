# Haptic Motor
## control bldc motor to mimic the haptic 
currently only for:
arduino mega
12v 800kv bldc motor
30N06L MOSFET as voltage gated switch
12v 1A power supply

## haptic pattern snippet
simple code snippet to easily see the control and test the feeling.

## next step
buying a AS560 sensor board so that this can work with the arduino simple foc project.
